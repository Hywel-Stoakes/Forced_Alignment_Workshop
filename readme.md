# An Introduction to Forced Alignment Using MAUS

This workshop forms part of the Experimental Phonetics course at The University of Melbourne and goes through the basics of uploading files and extracting output from MAUS (<https://clarin.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/BASWebServices/interface/WebMAUSBasic>). The files contained here are for research purposes.

To run the files you will need access to the `W8_data.zip` that can be downloaded by enrolled students from Canvas.

-   These files can be unzipped and put in the root folder of the project in a folder called `data`.
